**Report on Database Modeling**

**1. Introduction**

Database modeling is considered essential in the development of information systems, as it dictates the storage structure and organization of data. In this report, the detailed process of database modeling will be discussed, including the methods employed, the results obtained, and the conclusions drawn from this process.

**2. Methods**

For the database modeling, MySQL Workbench was utilized, a popular tool offering robust features for creating and visualizing ER diagrams, as well as generating SQL scripts for database implementation.

The process followed the subsequent steps:

- Identification of system requirements: System requirements for the help desk system were analyzed to understand the data that needs to be stored and their relationships.
- Definition of entities and their attributes: Entities and their attributes were identified, including Clients, Technicians, and Service Orders, along with their respective attributes.
- Establishment of relationships: Relationships between entities were determined, such as the relationship between Clients and Service Orders.
- Normalization of the database: The database was ensured to comply with normal forms to avoid data redundancy and inconsistency.

**3. Results**

The results of the database modeling include:

- A complete ER diagram showing the entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them.
- SQL scripts generated by MySQL Workbench to create tables in the database.
- A database structure that meets the requirements of the help desk system, ensuring data efficiency and integrity.

**4. Conclusions**

Database modeling is an essential part of information system development. It provides a solid foundation for data storage and management, ensuring that the system is efficient, scalable, and easy to maintain.

Throughout this report, the database modeling process, from requirements identification to schema implementation in MySQL Workbench, has been explored. It is concluded that careful modeling is fundamental to the success of a software development project.

**Case Study: Help Desk System**

To illustrate the practical application of database modeling, consider a case study of a help desk system for a technology company.

In this system, customers can register support requests, which are assigned to technicians for resolution. Each request is related to a specific customer's equipment. Through database modeling, we can define the structure to store information about customers, technicians, equipment, and service orders, enabling efficient tracking of support requests and ensuring customer satisfaction.
